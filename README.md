## Notes

I had a difficult time getting the side Nav to be in place. When using a fized position, the rest of the application treated the nav as a ghost and would go underneath it.
The problem was solved by treating the nav like any other component and using flex box with flow-direction row. I am over simplifing the solution for the sake of discussion. Many problems came up when trying to keep the nav a fixed size and without scrolling effecting it.
